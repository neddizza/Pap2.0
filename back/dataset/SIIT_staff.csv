","Performance Based Analysis and Design of Concrete Mix Proportions
Simulation models for predicting materials, mix proportion, time and environment dependent properties of concrete are studied. At present, the studied properties are workability, workability loss, strength, thermal cracking, autogenous and drying shrinkages, cracking resistance, carbonation, chloride induced corrosion, and sulfate resistance. Computer software is being improved for performance analysis and design purposes. Results of the research works are utilized in the establishment of “Design Considering Durability and Service Life” for concrete structures in Thailand.

Proper Use of Binders and Fillers as Cement Replacing Materials in Concrete
Studies on the properties of concrete with various kinds of powder materials are conducted. The materials are: fly ash and CaCO3 powder, etc. Optimizing the use of these materials and introduction of multibinder systems to the concrete industry are the aims of this project. Effect of fly ash with high free lime and SO3 content on properties of concrete is also studied for modifying the current fly ash specification. Durability of systems with multi binders is studied for optimizing the use of the multi binder system.

Use of Bottom Ash in Concrete
The use of bottom ash as a partial replacement of fine aggregate is studied. Some merits were observed when the replacement proportions and other control properties were appropriate. The targets of this study are to introduce the use of bottom ash to the concrete industry as well as to establish a standard for utilizing bottom ash as a partial replacing material for fine aggregate.

Maintenance of Concrete Structures
Research works and their applications on inspection, repair, maintenance, life cycle evaluation, and maintenance management of concrete structures are carried out. The works are parts of the program to develop appropriate maintenance codes and standards for concrete structures in Thailand.

Advanced Finite Element Analysis
","Automation in Structural Design

Structural design can be classified into several design tasks. These tasks need different degrees of human intuition. Those design tasks that require little human intuition and can be systematically written as algorithms may be easily delegated to computers. In contrast, other design tasks that require a lot of human intuition and do not have clear algorithms cannot be done without designers’ experiences. Although it may seem that some of the heuristic design tasks are not difficult and can be handled quite easily even by engineers, in practice, these easy tasks unfortunately prevent the whole design process from being completely automated. In this research area, artificial intelligence (AI) and other advanced computing technologies will be used to remove these hindrances, created by heuristic design tasks, in order that complete structural design automation can be developed.

Advanced Finite Element Analysis

It can be safely said that the finite element method (FEM) is currently the best method for solving mechanical problems. The method has been continuously developed and its progress is quite noticeable. Nevertheless, the development of FEM has been mainly concentrated on the theoretical part of the method. It is now time to integrate new computing technologies with FEM in order that advanced finite element analysis can be performed with ease. In this research area, advanced computing technologies, such as new programming technologies, artificial intelligence, information technologies, and database technologies, will be used to improve the performance and usability of FEM.",PROFESSOR,"1996-Present: SIIT

","Community Based Environmental Protection (CBEP)

CBEP is a new approach to environmental protection. Traditionally, environmental protection programs have focused on the command and control approach, which have been very effective at reducing point source pollution and improving environmental quality. However, some environmental problems, such as non-point source pollution are less amenable to these programs. CBEP will supplement and complement the traditional environmental protection approach by focusing on the health of an ecosystem and the behavior of humans that live in the ecosystem’s boundaries. This study is aiming to 1) comprehensively identify local environmental concerns, 2) set priorities and goals that reflect overall community concerns, and 3) develop comprehensive, long-term solution to environmental problems.

Products Life-Cycle Assessment (LCA)

Life-cycle assessment (LCA) is used to quantify the environmental inputs and outputs of a product or process, from the mining of raw materials, through production, distribution, use and reuse or recycling, to final disposal. There are two main stages of LCA: inventory analysis and impact assessment. Inventory analysis involves the quantification of environmental inputs and outputs throughout a product or process’s lifetime. The inventory analysis is aiming to identify a list of pollutants that may have an impact on the environment. The purpose of the impact assessment is to aggregate and evaluate the potential environmental impacts identified in the inventory. This study will be focusing on particular kinds of waste which have high potential to be a major environmental problem in the future, mobile phone and its batteries, as an example in order to develop waste management plan and minimize the amount of waste before hand.

Waste Management

Waste management is one of the major long-term problems in our society. Cost-effective, environ-mentally sound management of wastes continues to be an unstable issue, the solution of which must integrate science, technology, individual awareness, and policy. Waste management begins with understanding the complete and detailed physical, chemical, and biological characteristics of the waste in question. This understanding is crucial to successful utilization or environmentally sound disposal measures. Additionally, waste management enables us to predict what is in a material, how much is there, how it may leach out, and how it will ultimately impact the environment.

Supply Chain Management (SCM)
","Large-Scale Simulation and Optimization

Many problems in the real world are large and complex. Researchers in this field are trying to improve the algorithm and utilize available computational technology such as parallelism or grid computing to solve such problems where their resulting models are also very large. This technology also enables researchers to have a detail model which is close to the real world problem. Some examples of these problems are transportation problem in the urban area (where there consists of millions of people driving on thousands of streets), financial simulation, bioinformatics, and large-scale planning.

Supply Chain Management (SCM)

The researches in SCM involve the study of the process of planning, implementing, and controlling the operations of the supply chain with the purpose of reducing cost and increasing efficiency. SCM includes all movement and storage of raw materials, work-in-process inventory, and finished goods from origin to consumption. There are many problems that can be modeled by simulation and optimization models.

Dynamic Topology Wireless Network
Active Network
","Overlay Networks

Overlay networks are user-definable networks created over the underlying Internet (IP) networks which typically serve end- users with the best-effort service model. In overlay networks, overlay nodes which serve as the service access point and data forwarding facility utilize redundant paths and bandwidths of the Internet to transfer their service data. Since the overlay nodes are owned by the application-service providers (ASP) instead of the Internet Service Provider (ISP), all aspects of the overlay network including topology and application-specific QoS (Quality of Service) can be customized. Several research topics are still open in designing such an overlay network. These include overlay network creation strategy, overlay network topology adaptation, multipath flow routing protocol, application-oriented overlay routing protocol, overlay network service provisioning protocol, etc.

Dynamic Topology Wireless Network

Recently, wireless network services are widely available due to the availability of smaller, smarter and cheaper portable devices, inexpensive wireless technology, and mobile user’s demand for “anyone anywhere anytime” information access. There has been much interest in dynamic wireless networks which can evolve/adapt themselves according to the changes of the volume and geographical distribution of services’ demands generated by the end users. One possible solution is to let network equipment such as the wireless service access points or mobile routers change their positions appropriately to such demand changes in order to maintain the service quality and best utilize networking resources. The research topics include user tracking algorithms, users’ demand anticipation algorithms, topology adaptation algorithms, very fast dynamic routing algorithms, etc.

Active Network

Currently, networks become more and more dynamic in terms of both their size and their provided services. The existing execution paradigm of the routers may not react well to such networks’ dynamism. Active networking is the framework which allows sending code (executed at any intermediate network node) with the users’ information inside the data packets. This allows the possibility of highly tailored and rapid “real-time” changes to the underlying network operation according to the dynamism of the networks. For an example, the data packets can decide to change their way themselves when facing link failure or finding better paths. The overlay node is one of the potential applications of the active networking. Active network research addresses the nature of how best to incorporate extremely dynamic capability within networks. The research topics include active code structure, active node execution architecture, active code security, etc.",ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,"1999 - Present : SIIT

Polylactide (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester that is of interest in various applications, due to its biodegradability, biocompatibility, and renewable monomer resources. In addition, properties of this polymer can be modified for use in specific applications by copolymerization or blending with other polymers. In our lab, various lactide-based copolymers have been synthesized, e.g., poly(D-lactide), poly(L-lactide), poly(DL-lactide), poly(lactide-co-ethylene glycol), poly(lactide-co-glycidol), poly(lactide-co-ethylene terephthalate). The copolymers are then used in various applications, for example, as fertilizer controlled-release materials, packaging materials, and in biomedical, environmental and energy applications. Micro- and nanoencapsulation techniques and electrospinning methods are employed in the preparation of the materials.

Conventional and Two-Dimensional FTIR Spectroscopy

Infrared spectroscopy is a fundamental analytical technique that is widely used in material characterization. Recently, an advanced methodology, two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy (2D-FTIR) has been developed, which provides notable advantages over conventional FTIR. For example, an improvement in band resolution, simplicity in band assignment, and determination of relative order of responses of specific functional groups to external perturbation, have been achieved. The FTIR and 2D-FTIR techniques have been applied in characterizations of various materials, e.g., polymers, fuels, and minerals.

","Biohydrogen Production

Hydrogen is a promising alternative to fossil fuels. It is a clean, renewable, carbon-free energy carrier of the future. It has a heating value of approximately 2.5 times greater than that of methane and can be used in fuel cells with high efficiency. When combusted, it produces water rather than greenhouse gases. Hydrogen can be derived from various means, chemically or biologically, each with its own set of advantages and disadvantages. Biohydrogen production is an environmentally friendly method employing either natural or genetically-modified microbial communities to produce hydrogen. Prior to the establishment of full-scale biohydrogen production, substantial, fundamental research is needed to address the key capabilities of the system so that high hydrogen production rates and efficiency can be achieved.

ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation (ANAMMOX)

The ANaerobic AMMonium OXidation (ANAMMOX) process involves the use of nitrite as an electron acceptor in the bacterially mediated oxidation of ammonia to yield di-nitrogen gas. The process allows nitrogen transformation similar to the classical processes of nitrification followed by denitrification. However, it reduces oxygen demand and requires no additional organic carbon source as compared to typical nitrification and denitrification, respectively. It is a promising microbial process to remove ammonia from wastewater characterized by a low content of organic materials.

Assimilable Organic Carbon (AOC) and Regrowth Potential in Drinking Water

During the past decade, research interest in drinking water treatment has focused on the biodegradable fraction of organic carbon in natural and treated water. This interest stems from the recognition that biodegradable organic matter in water can provide growth support to microorganisms which can be intensified during storage, and travel within the distribution systems. Such phenomenon is known as biological regrowth, and the fraction of biodegradable organic carbon is commonly termed biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) or assimilable organic carbon (AOC). Biological regrowth in distribution systems has been known for years, as a potential cause of corrosion in distribution lines and deterioration of finished water quality, as well as an indirect link to waterborne diseases. It has, however, just come under attention , particularly for developed countries, due to the unclear impact on human health.

","Removal of Heavy Metals and other Pollutants from Aqueous Solution/Sludges using Agriculture Waste Materials and other Low Cost Adsorbents

Agricultural wastes are unused resources, which in many cases present a serious problem of disposal. However, these waste materials can be used to remove toxic heavy metal and other pollutants from wastewater as they are capable of binding by adsorption, chelation, and ion exchange. The exchange properties of these wastes can be attributed to the presence of carboxylic, phenolic, and hydroxylic groups. In order to enhance cation exchange capacities, these groups may be modified by oxidation, carboxymethylation, acetylation, and phosphation. The utilization of agricultural by-products in treating the wastewater/sludges contaminated by heavy metals and other pollutants is an attractive area of research.

Biohydrogen Production

Hydrogen produced from biomass in a sustainable way is recognized as an important component of the fuel market for future low or non-carbon based energy systems. A combination of hydrogen with fuel cells can help in saving energy. Agro-industrial wastewater rich in organics can be used for biohydrogen production using a dark fermentation process. Biohydrogen production can be enhanced by using an enzyme which can degrade complex organics to simpler compounds. This can be coupled with a Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC). Microbial Fuel Cell (MFC), a bioreactor, can convert chemical energy in the chemical bonds in organic compounds into electrical energy through catalytic reactions of microorganisms under anaerobic conditions. Thus, waste can be changed to a clean source of energy.

Phytoremediation for Treatment of Wastewater/ Contaminated Soil

Phytoremediation uses plants to clean wastewater/contaminated sites. It is the use of plants to partially or substantially remediate selected contaminants in contaminated soil, sludge, sediment, ground water, surface water and wastewater. It utilizes a variety of plant biological processes and the physical characteristics of plants to aid in remediation. Phytoremediation is widely viewed as the ecologically viable alternative to the environmentally destructive physical remediation methods currently practiced. Plants have several endogenous genetic, biochemical, and physiological properties that make them ideal agents for soil and water remediation. Phytoremediation uses hyperaccumulator and accumulator plants that can remove excess heavy metals from contaminated soils, wastewater and sludge.

One crucial property of nanomaterials is its large active surface area compared to that of conventional size materials. Several phenomena in nature such as adsorption and catalysis rely on interaction at the material interfaces and the use of nanomaterials can help to amplify or to better utilize these interface effects. The focus here has been on utilization of magnetic nanoparticles in separation of contaminants/ active components in several systems such as in environmental remediation, biomedical system and in heterogeneous catalysis. Ability of these nanoparticles to bind specifically to the interested target and to be separated or concentrated magnetically can also be exploited in sensing applications. Optical detection based mainly in infrared and UV-Visible regions are also being developed.

The shortage of energy is becoming an important problem for mankind and the research of renewable energy has emerged rapidly to solve this problem. One interesting renewable energy is the energy from hydrogen fuel cells. Therefore, one of the most important issues to be considered for the hydrogen fuel cell is effective hydrogen production. Hydrogen could be produced from reforming reactions of hydrocarbons such as methane, methanol, ethanol, dimethyl ether, etc. This research focuses on methanol reforming to produce hydrogen for fuel cells from the steam reforming reaction. Unfortunately, the process still requires a huge amount of energy in order to produce a high yield of hydrogen. This is a major drawback of hydrogen production from the reforming reaction. The objective of this research is to study the performance of various catalysts from different preparation methods to identify the proper catalyst for methanol reforming. The optimization of the catalytic reactor design and reaction conditions are also investigated to enhance the reaction system for effective hydrogen production from methanol reforming.

Carbon Dioxide Capture by Immobilized Amine over Solid Sorbents

The high performance of amine solid sorbents could provide the alternative for CO2 capture from power plant flue gases. The concept is to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from a simulated flue gas system by a tubular reactor using immobilized amine species on different solid sorbent support (activated carbon, zeolites, agriculture product waste) at ambient conditions. The concepts of the material preparation are high performance of CO2 capture, cost effectiveness, and easy handling for various applications. The preliminary design of a scaled up plant for the CO2capture from solid sorbents is also considered in the study.

Photocatalysis

CO2 emission has become a worldwide problem due to its potential impact on global warming. Photocatalytic reactions, which involve the combined use of photo energy and catalysts to convert reactants to products, provide a promising alternative to reduce CO2 and convert it into useful hydrocarbon products (e.g., methane and methanol).

","Polymer and Surfactant for Biomedical Applications
In conventional tissue engineering techniques, cells are grown on tissue culture polystyrene plates; these cells are then harvested by disaggregating the extracellular matrix (ECM) through the proteolytic action of trypsin or by chelating the Ca2+ and Mg2+ ions with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). However, nonspecific proteases can damage crucial cell surface proteins, resulting in decline of cell function. A new technique using a temperature-responsive polymer grafted on a cell culture substrate has been investigated as an alternative. In the past few decades, poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIAM) has been extensively studied for this application. We are interested in developing a technique for grafting the copolymer of N-isopropylarylamide and acrylamide, poly(PNIAM-co-AM), onto commercial TCP surface using ultraviolet (UV) irradiation. It is a simple grafting technique without using expensive equipment, and it also provides more choices for tissue culture researchers who can choose a method that is compatible with their cell types and their facilities.

","Template synthesis of novel carbon materials
Zero-, one-, two-dimensional sp2-hybridized carbon materials, e.g., fullerene, carbon nanotubes, and graphenes, are well-known carbon allotropes. Scientists naturally expect their analogical substance, i.e., three-dimensional graphene-based ordered architecture (known as Schwarzite). By using a template carbonization approach, variety of interesting carbon materials with an ordered pore structure can be synthesized. Introduction of a large amount of carbon into the confined nanochannels of zeolite template could lead to a formation of a novel carbon structure, such as fullerene network and even Schwarzite, which is an as-yet-unsynthesized hypothetic material and would probably show specific properties due to its unique valence electron structure.

Functionalization of carbon frameworks and their applications for electrochemical energy storage
Carbon materials with high specific surface area are commonly used as electrodes for electrochemical capacitors (or supercapacitors). However, their applications are still limited by relatively low energy density. This research aims to develop hybrid carbon-based electrode by finely tunning their surface functionalities, which lead to an energy density enhancement resulting from a pseudocapacitance. Some other hybrid systems, such as an asymmetric and a redox capacitors will be also investigated.

Many numerical models had been developed to compute sediment transport rate. However, most of the models were developed under limited experimental conditions. Therefore their validity is limited according to the range of experimental conditions which were employed in the calibration. The evidence is that many models exist. The main objective of this research is to develop a reliable sediment transport model based on a wide range of experimental conditions.",ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,"1997-Present: SIIT.

","Earthquake Resistant Structural Design

The goal of the research is to study the seismic performance of sub-standard non-ductile reinforced concrete members and develop a suitable structural design approach for buildings and bridges. The research begins with the evaluation of seismic performance of existing sub-standard reinforced concrete members in buildings and bridges. Several critical components such as sub-assemblages, beam-column joint, column, etc., will be tested. The failure mechanism of these critical components will be investigated. Then, appropriate design methods and reinforcement detailing shall be proposed. The research will emphasize reinforcement detailing in plastic hinge zones, shear failure in joints and columns, confinement, bond distress and lap splice failure and column hinging mechanisms.

Seismic Retrofit of Reinforced Concrete Buildings

The objective of the research is to retrofit existing buildings and bridges against seismic effect. The cost-effective strengthening methods will be proposed for critical sub-assemblages or components of the structure. An example of a successful retrofit method is Joint Planar Expansion which strengthens the beam-column joint. The strengthening scheme will enhance not only the capacity and displacement but also will change the failure mode from brittle to ductile failure. The research will propose both component strengthening and structural system strengthening, such as steel bracing and shear wall addition. Advanced composite materials such as fiber reinforced polymers will also be used for retrofit.

Nonlinear Behavior and Modeling of Reinforced Concrete

The research includes the advanced study of the nonlinear behavior and modeling of reinforced concrete. A behavioral model of beam column joints will be developed that includes bond deterioration, joint shear failure, and splitting cracks in beams and columns. A strut and tie model is also applied to explain the flow of forces within the beam-column joint. Moreover, various numerical and finite element analysis tools are utilized to analyze the behavior of components and structures. The finite element models will be both member based and element based with the advanced state-of-the-art constitutive models of reinforced concrete.

The current research interest focuses on applications of multi criteria decision making techniques to solve civil engineering problems. Possible topics included engineering design, prioritization and evaluation of public measures, classification problems, etc. Some research topics require knowledge and cooperation from multi-disciplinary fields. Example of research ~ being conducted includes highway corridor planning, prioritization of highway accident reduction measures, landslide/seismic hazard zonation, seismic resistance and maintenance prioritization of existing buildings. Techniques such as the Analytic Network Process (ANP) and Fuzzy Decision Making Methods are used to solve the multicriteria decision making problems.

Highway Design Optimization

Highway design is the complex process that involves many constrains and objectives to be achieved. The conventional design method is manual. Therefore the number of alternatives is limited by the choices of the designer. It is also time and cost consuming to generate many alternatives by the manual design. The research aims to apply some heuristic techniques such as Genetic Algorithm (GA) and Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) to solve the highway design optimization problem within the Geographic Information System (GIS) environment.

","Application of Three-Dimensional Finite Element Method to Design of Steel Structures

In order to propose the improvement in the design methods of steel structures, the three-dimensional finite element method using shellelements is employed. For the local stress analysis of a complicated steel structure such as a long-span bridge, the hybrid model which combines shell and beam element mesh is developed. By carefully in investigating the behavior of steel box-girder, the assessment of shear lag effects on stress and deflection is proposed.

Development of Run-off-River Small Hydropower Projects

The run-of-river small hydropower is considered as one of promising renewable energy sources in Thailand, since it gives less environmental and social impacts. The feasibility study of the hydropower projects of this type is performed by considering engineering, economic and environmental criteria. The geographical inforamtion system (GIS) is adopted as a tool for the present study.

Development of Efficient Organic Waste Composting System for Small and Medium Communities

Composting as the treatment of the municipal solid waste has getting more promising as it has lesser effect to the environment. However, in the developing countries, it has usually been looked over due to its unflavored processes, and lacking of technology. To eliminate such problems, this research project was emerged to develop a better composting system. A pilot plant was set up, and a series of experiment was conducted to study the optimal composting conditions, which would maximize its efficiency in actuality. This will follow by the feasibility study and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of the proposal as a sustainable consideration for the solid waste treatment method for the future.

","Semantic Web

The basic idea of the Semantic Web is to describe the meaning of Web data in a way suitable for automatic reasoning. Expectedly, the Semantic Web technology will bring about large-scale heterogeneous Web knowledge bases with a qualitatively new level of service. The concept of ontology (domain theory) will play a key role as a formal, explicit specification of shared conceptualizations that describe the semantics of data on the Web. Formal ontology languages as well as meta-level representation of Web resources are investigated. The possibility of developing automated reasoning systems for Semantic Web is explored from both theoretical and practical viewpoints, e.g., a hybrid approach with a strict separation between ontology predicates and rule predicates and a homogeneous approach embedding rules and ontologies in a logical language. Realization of the Semantic Web vision demands further research works on several other knowledge-representation-related issues.

Information Extraction

Due to language-structure differences, when an information extraction (IE) framework that works well in one language is applied in a different language the framework often needs modification and supplementary components are often necessary. By incorporation of ontology-based semantic annotations and appropriate extraction filtering techniques, it is expected that IE based on patterns of triggering class tags and triggering plain words can be realized for Thai documents. We aim to develop a system for extracting semantic information from Thai text and representing extractions in a form of machine-processable frames. Extracted frames along with domain ontologies constitute a knowledge base from which logic-based reasoning engines can deduce several kinds of implicit information and relations. Application of this framework includes extraction of semantic frames from free-text abstracts of technical articles, which enables semantic document indexing and precise information retrieval based on semantic contents.

Reasoning with UML Diagrams

The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a graphical language, adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), for visualizing, specifying, constructing, and documenting the artifacts of a software-intensive system. As reported by recent works on the formal semantics of UML, there exist inherent interrelationships between components of a UML model. Such interrelationships constitute part of general knowledge about the domain of UML, which may be used for, e.g., deriving implicit properties and verifying the consistency of the model. A framework for knowledge representation and reasoning in the domain of UML is proposed, in which a UML model is represented as textual XML data, and the general knowledge about the UML domain as an XML declarative description. Development of an inference engine for automatic refinement of the encoded UML diagrams and derivation of implicit model properties is underway.

Equivalent-Transformation Computation Model

In declarative paradigms, a declarative description plays the role of a precise specification, and, at the same time, operates as a program. A number of works on amalgamation and generalization of declarative languages have been proposed. Most of them have been driven mainly by computation-oriented requirements, e.g., enhancement of operational semantics and integration of computation models; other important related concepts such as program synthesis and program transformation are investigated only afterwards and not inherent in their designs. By contrast, the equivalent transformation (ET) paradigm takes a program-synthesis-oriented approach, i.e., effective generation of efficient and correct programs from specifications is its underlying design motivation. Investigation of the ET computation model is in progress from both theoretical and application viewpoints .

","Software for Optimization of the Tool-Path of Industrial Milling Robots

Innovations in the field of mechanical engineering have enhanced the involvement of milling robots in various manufacturing processes. Nowadays, computer guided milling machines are employed to produce free-shape surfaces in mass manufacturing industries such as automobile, airplane, ship-building, etc. However, several physical phenomena, such as machine kinematics, thermal effects, static and dynamic loading, and common-cause failures often affect the quality of the desired surface. Although recent research papers have displayed a number of advanced methods to improve the characteristics of machining, a robust algorithm to generate the optimal tool-path for geometrically complex workpieces is still an open problem.

Medical Image Processing
Image processing has revolutionized the modern medicine. The images generated by tomography (CT scan, MRI, ultrasound, PET), electroencephalography, magnetoencephalography can be processed and analyzed by computers. Combined with the rapidly enhancing performances of graphics processors, improved programming support, the mathematical models designed for computer aided imaging and diagnostics can detect early signs of the decease and save lives. The Biomedical Unit of SIIT leaded by Dr. Makhanov collaborates with advanced medical centers of radiology to develop new image processing methods to diagnose early stages of cancer.

Grid Generation Technologies

Grid generation techniques emerged as a sub-discipline of Computational Fluid Dynamics in the early seventies. Nowadays grid generators are among the major components employed by versatile codes in Geometrical Modeling, Computer Graphics, CAD/CAM, Structural Analysis, Aerodynamics and Computational Fluid Dynamics. However, in spite of considerable efforts and a long time spent on curvilinear and moving grid generation, the theoretical principles have not been yet established. Grid generation today is still much more of an art than a science. Since many different approaches exist and are being used, creative craftsmen are needed to operate the various packages. Therefore, from an industrial point of view, issues surrounding efficient implementation, interactive, graphical user interface, visualization and software engineering in grid generation are of paramount importance.

Robust NLP and Linguistic Knowledge AcquisitionWhile NLP systems are gradually becoming accepted by a wider range of people both in academic and business area, many difficult problems are still unsolved. One of the important problems is how to improve robustness and adaptiveness in NLP system, especially how to analyze and interpret various phrases and sentences which are ungrammatical (also called ill-formed inputs). A user-friendly system should be robust and flexible in that it can analyze any well-formed and ill-formed input efficiently. The system should also be adaptive to deal with phrases/sentences including unseen construction and vocabulary, for instance learning some new grammar rules. Currently, we are focusing on both rule-based and corpus-based approaches to cope with ill-formed inputs and, when needed, to acquire novel linguistic knowledge. On the increase of very large electronic corpora, statistics obtained from such corpora are a useful clue for this problem.
Text Interpretation: Information Retrieval, Categorization and Information ExtractionIn the past, most online information stored in databases or spreadsheets. At the present time, the majority of online information is text-based, e.g., e-mail, news, journal articles, reports, books, encyclopedias. These information sources are worth but there is too much information available, and not enough time to sort through it. Text interpretation techniques are helpful for categorizing, filtering and extracting information from text. Three types of text interpretation are information retrieval, categorization, and information extraction. We are interested in developing of efficient methods to various tasks of text interpretation.

Knowledge Data Discovery in DatabaseKnowledge Data Discovery (KDD) is a rapidly growing interdisciplinary field that merges together databases, statistics, machine learning and other AI technologies in order to extract useful knowledge from a large-scaled collection of data. The problems in this field are of two general categories: (1) prediction and (2) knowledge discovery. Knowledge discovery is a stage prior to prediction, where information is insufficient for prediction, such as clustering, association rules, text mining and so on. Our study aims at finding and implementing efficient, robust and scalable methods in real-world situation where databases are complex, voluminous, noisy and non-stationary. Some interesting applications include computer-aided education (CAI), decision support systems, and management information systems.
Intelligent Decision Support SystemsIn business, government, and other organizations, decision making plays an important part in determining the landscape of tomorrow’s world. Computer systems that assist decision-making process are called decision support systems (DSSs). Intelligent decision support systems (IDSSs) are DSSs that make use of techniques emerging from the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Our research focuses on studying new techniques in both (1) model-driven support systems, which are based on strong theory or model, and (2) data-driven support systems, which are based on database technologies and statistical methods.

","Image Segmentation Using Texture and Relaxation Labeling Algorithms

When normal density or intensity segmentation is not effective enough, a new representation of texture which is derived from the spatial energy of the texture is introduced in order to segment the given image. From the energy values, a 2D histogram of texture is generated. The texture histogram is used to discriminate textures and to retrieve image segmentation. In an attempt to assess the similarities in the regional areas, the property of adjacency could be useful. This characteristic of pixels is defined as a co-occurrence matrix, which is an important tool in Image Segmentation using Texture and Relaxation Labeling Algorithms.

Medical Image Processing

Taking advantage of the high capability of computers, offering advantages over film based systems, several image processing techniques are of interest, especially for medical purposes in order to get most of the information out of the given medical images. Essentially, medical imaging can make use of texture information, texture feature classification or texture segmentation because of the nature of the medical image itself. Medical assessment can then be made fully automated later on and this will lead to a reduction of human errors, increasing of consistency and repeatability. This can be distributed to the remote areas or hospitals that lack sophisticated treatment facilities or trained experts.",ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,"2002-Present: SIIT

Multidimensional System/Robust Control
Signal Processing for Communication and Coding Theory
","Digital Signal Processing

Multidimensional signal processing has become more popular lately due to its efficiency and greater degree of freedom in the design. However, the design and analysis of multidimensional systems are generally more complicated and requires thorough understanding of abstract algebra. Applications of multidimensional DSP include image compression, video coding, multi-sensor system design, filter bank design and wavelet.

Multidimensional System/Robust Control

Over several decades, great effort has been invested in the finding of a multivariate (n-D) polynomial matrix factorization algorithm. The problem has been completely solved only for the bivariate case. Recently with the usage of Groebner basis and conventional algebra, some n-D matrix factorization algorithms have been developed for some special cases. The general problem however, remains open. The solution to this problem will simultaneously solve many other important problems and can be directly applied to the multidimensional system realization and synthesis.

Signal Processing for Communication and Coding Theory

Many signal processing techniques such as adaptive filtering and spectral analysis are used to improve the fidelity of the transmission and reception of digital signals. Unlike source coding, channel coding is used for the purpose of protecting the transmitted bit stream from erroneous receiving. Correction and detection of error bits by means of algebraic coding techniques such as 1-D and 2-D convolutional code are usually employed. Topics of interest include: adaptive filtering, power spectrum estimation, array processing, 2-D convolutional code design, and application-specific coding design.

Algebraic topology, Cryptography, Intelligent User Interface (IUI), and Machine learning

","Algebraic Topology
Cryptography
Intelligent User Interface (IUI)
Machine Learning
","Algebraic Topology is a branch of mathematics which uses tools from abstract algebra to study topological spaces. The basic goal is to find algebraic invariants that classify topological spaces up to homeomorphism. The word “Topology” comes from the Greek words “topos”, which means place, and “logos”, which means study. Topology is the study of the properties of spaces that are invariant (preserved) under deformations, twisting, and stretching. It is often said that a topologist is a person who cannot tell the difference between their doughnut and their coffee mug, since each can be continuously deformed to the other (each is a solid sphere with one handle).

Cryptography can be summarized at a high level as the theory and practice of controlling information. Simple examples of its applications can be found in many places in modern society-perhaps the most prominent is that of securing electronic commerce. Branches of cryptography touch many areas of mathematics and computer science, including algebra, number theory, combinatorics and complexity theory, to name a few.

Intelligent User Interface (IUI) is a study on the development of human-machine interfaces that work naturally to the users, as well as improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the interaction. The goal of IUI is basically fulfilled by applying various techniques from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Statistics, such as knowledge representation and reasoning, user modeling, gesture recognition, natural language processing, etc.

Machine Learning is a field of study that focuses on automatically constructing models from a set of collected examples. The obtained model can be used to predict the properties of the data found in the future. For example, a credit card company may need a model to predict if a payment made through their credit card is fraud or not. Manually constructing a model takes huge efforts and it may miss some fraudulent behaviors. Machine Learning helps reduce the required efforts, and wisely utilize a large amount of collected data.

Feature detection and image segmentation are the primary areas of my research interests. Analysis of 3-D maxillofacial image data is the title of my doctoral dissertation, which focused on the analysis of the human dentition and jawbone for orthodontic treatment and surgery. The extraction of anatomical features in retinal images is one of my recent research topics.

Computer Vision and Remote Sensing

Depth estimation and motion analysis are the areas of my long-term research interests. Depth estimation is the central issue in dealing with stereo (or more) images, while motion analysis is concerned with the process of time-sequential images. I am particularly interested in the correspondence problem that has to be solved for estimating both depth and motion.

Object Classification and Recognition

Image understanding is another area of my interests. This category has various applications for biometrics and industry, such as security control, parts inspection, grading and sorting, etc. A popular research topic in biometrics is human face recognition which I have worked on.

","H∞ Control
Robust Control
","H∞ Control
The advent of H∞ control was a truly remarkable innovation in multivariable theory. It eliminated the classical/modern dichotomy by formulating the design issues of classical control property and has solved it based on the state-space tool of modern theory. The theory-practice gap was no longer a significant issue at the beginning of the 1990s due to a number of successful applications of H∞ control to real design problems, especially applications of H∞ control based robust control theory.

Robust Control
No mathematical system can exactly model a physical system. Nowadays it is gradually being recognized that the real issue of control engineering we were faced with was the difficulty of modeling the plant to be controlled. For this reason we must be aware of how modeling errors might adversely affect the performance of a control system. Robust control theory became the most popular area that was expected to deal with model uncertainty.

","Description Logic
Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) is a prominent research field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In essence, the goal of knowledge representation is to describe and store knowledge in a systematic and machine understandable way. Having knowledge stored properly in this way, automated reasoning can be employed in order to, for instance, detect inconsistencies and infer implicit knowledge. Several approaches to KRR have been proposed and considered in the AI literature, but some of the most important approaches are based on logic, in particular Description Logics. Description Logics form a successful family of knowledge representation formalisms with two key assets: formally well-defined semantics which allows representing knowledge in an unambiguous way and automated reasoning which allows inferring implicit knowledge from knowledge given explicitly.

Semantic Web Ontologies
The eXtensible Markup Language (XML) has been introduced to address the limitations of the Hyper-Text Markup Language (HTML), namely the lack of document structures. Despite a big success in several applications, XML still fails to fulfill the Semantic Web vision, which aims at describing the meaning (semantics) of Web data in a way suitable for automated reasoning. To solve this issue, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and RDF Schema (RDFS) are used to construct a data model and define a domain-specific terminology, respectively. With a logical underpinning based on Description Logics, RDF and RDFS have been considerably extended to the Web Ontology Language (OWL), a W3C recommendation of ontology language for the Semantic Web. A collection of OWL ontologies will form an indispensible ingredient toward realization of the Semantic Web vision. Although several tools and reasoning techniques are readily available for modeling OWL ontologies, further challenges still remain.",ASSISTANT PROFESSOR,"2009-Present: SIIT

Machine Learning
Pattern Recognition 
","Intelligent User Interface (IUI) is a study on the development of human-machine interfaces that work naturally to the users, as well as improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the interaction. The goal of IUI is basically fulfilled by applying various techniques from Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Statistics, such as knowledge representation and reasoning, user modeling, gesture recognition, natural language processing, etc.

Machine Learning is a field of study that focuses on automatically constructing models from a set of collected examples. The obtained model can be used to predict the properties of the data found in the future. For example, a credit card company may need a model to predict if a payment made through their credit card is a fraud or not. Manually constructing a model takes huge efforts and it may miss some fraudulent behaviors. Machine Learning helps reduce the required efforts, and wisely utilize a large amount of collected data.

Pattern Recognition aims to construct a model that represents patterns of interested objects. The model is typically built using supervised machine learning techniques. It is applied in wide areas of applications, for example, Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is a software component converting the scanned image of characters into text. Handwriting Recognition converts users’ handwritten strokes into a sequence of characters.",ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR,"2005-Present: SIIT

System Identification
","Robust and Adaptive Control Theories and Applications

Control engineering is a rapidly evolving discipline with a wide range of applications, including but not limited to chemical, electrical, mechanical, and civil systems. However, the mathematical models upon which control theories are based can never precisely describe all the characteristics of any given system. This uncertainty is a direct result of various factors, such as incomplete system knowledge, variable dynamics and parameters, complex physical mechanisms, and external disturbances. The discrepancy between a physical system and its mathematical description is therefore an issue of grave concern for control engineers. Robust and adaptive control theories have emerged as highly efficient tools for dealing with uncertainties, capable of guaranteeing robust and stable system performance under varying operational conditions. This research aims at developing robust and adaptive control strategies, with particular emphasis on mechanical and electrical systems. Possible applications include vibration suppression of automotive systems, automation of industrial processes, force feedback and haptic interfacing.

System Identification

The accuracy and performance of any control system is greatly dependent upon the mathematical model on which it is based. Thus, there is a strong correlation between the practice of control engineering and system identification. System identification refers to the use of measured data in combination with stochastic or deterministic methods to discern the structure and relevant parameters of a given system. As such, it is an invaluable tool when dealing with systems with uncertain or unknown mathematical models and parameters. This research is concerned primarily with applying system identification theories to complex systems involving nonlinearities and hybrid models.

Image Processing: The Image Analysis is the study of how to process or analyze the image to obtain needed information such as the approximated location, the region, or the number of the interested object in the image.   
My research work is medical image processing which involves processing and the image in the medical field and aims to solve the medical problems related in such a field.  The first work involves localization and segmentation of Optic Disk (OD) in the retina images using techniques that are based on information from vessel networks rather than the information from optic disk.  The second work involves calculating the midline shift distance and the approximating the volume of the hemorrhage from the series of the 2-D brain CT scan-slide images.  
 
Information Retrieval: Information retrieval (IR) is the way of retrieving needed information from a collection of information resources which are commonly based on text.  Improving the accuracy and reducing the speed are main objectives in this field.  
My research work in this field involved enhance the performance of the well-known search engine scheme: Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) for retrieval using Sn,k gram (a skip gram that allows k gaps between n-term unit.

Audio Information Hiding: The audio Information Hiding (AIH) is a study of how to embed information such as a text or an image in an audio signal in such a way that the information is difficult to remove and inaudible in the audio. It is typically used to serve the purposes of ownership protection, content authentication, broadcast monitoring, information carrier, and convert communication. 
My research work in this field involves a novel approach for audio watermarking based on Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA).

We are interested in a wide range of topics in wireless networking and communications in both single-hop and multi-hop networks. For single-hop wireless networks, we have done research on queuing performance analysis of dynamic schedulers using asymptotic approximation based on large-deviations theory. We have also studied OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access) systems, in particular, in a) showing delay-optimality of a dynamic load-balancing scheduler in multi-queue multi-server systems; b) studying dynamic scheduling of OFDMA subcarriers with partial feedback of the channel information but full knowledge of queue information; c) studying the interplay between rate-adaptive sources such as TCP and dynamic OFDMA schedulers.
For multi-hop wireless networks, we have studied road emergency message broadcasting in vehicular networks to avoid road accidents.

Applications of Argumentation
","Argumentation

Argumentation is a form of reasoning, that could be viewed as a dispute resolution, in which the participants present their arguments to establish, defend or attack certain propositions. A theoretical study of argumentation may be about mechanisms for constructing of arguments and the attack relation between arguments; argumentation semantics for deciding which arguments to accept and which arguments to reject; or proof procedures to compute the acceptability of arguments for different arguemntation semantics.

Applications of Argumentation

Argumentation has provided a basis for understanding non-monotonic and defeasible reasoning, a promising platform for investigating decision making, negotiation, legal reasoning, learning, dispute resolution, dialogues, multi-agents and sensor networks.

","Software Engineering

Software engineering (SE) is concerned with designing, developing and maintaining high-quality software systems that satisfy all the customers’ requirements. Our research focuses on how to design and apply the technologies and practices needed to acquire, develop, operate, and sustain software systems that are innovative, affordable, trustworthy, and enduring. We performs research to explore promising solutions to software engineering problems. Our research topics include software architecture, software process model, software quality assurance and process improvement.

Semantic Web and Knowledge Engineering

Semantic web is an effort to enhance current web so that computers can process the information presented on World Wide Web (WWW), interpret and connect it, to help humans to find required knowledge. If we consider WWW as a huge distributed hypertext system, semantic web will be considered as a huge distributed knowledge based system. The focus of semantic web is to provide a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across applications, enterprise, and community boundaries. Our research focuses on two problems, first how to capture knowledge and represent it in an explicit format such as ontology so it can be shared, integrated, processed and reused by the systems. Second, how to apply semantic web technology and research to create intelligent systems to solve real-world problems.

Service Science and Service Innovation

Service science applies insights from scientific, management, marketing and engineering perspectives to design, create and manage a service system based on service-dominant logics. A service system is a configuration of policy, business process and essential resources (e.g. people, knowledge, tools and technology) that aims to deliver value to both service providers and clients. This research focuses on solving current issues in service industry by introducing tools to help the organization to manage and maintain service quality and designing service innovations using information technology to increase co-creation, productivity, accessibility and scalabity of services as long as be able to maintain the satisfied level of quality of services.

","Social Media Understanding

Text from social media is significant key information to understand social movement. However, the length of the social media text is typically short and concise with a lot of absent words. Our task is to identify the proper keyword representing the message content that we are accounting for. Instead of training the model for keyword extraction directly from the Twitter messages, we propose a new method to fine-tune the model trained from some known documents containing richer context information. We conducted the experiment on Twitter messages and expressed in word cloud timeline. It shows a promising result.

Asian WordNet (http://www.asianwordnet.org)

WordNet is widely used in NLP research because its important feature of computability. Each word in WordNet is expressed in a set of synonym words called synset, and defined in a semantic relational structure to each other. The based WordNet is created for the English language definition. Since the words in WordNet are defined by set of words, it is quite acceptable to generate other language WordNet by translating each word in the synset. We proposed an algorithm that can disambiguate the word by considering the synonym, and its English translation. Asian WordNet (AWN) is therefore generated for many Asian languages by using each local English dictionary.

Digitized Thailand (http://www.digitized-thailand.org)


The aim of the project is to create the country digital platform. We realize that many database and applications cannot be easily shared or connected to provide a higher integrated solution. Initially, the project stimulated the data digitization and application development following the provided API standard. Beyond the efforts in Digitized Thailand initiative, we created a huge useful database such as cultural information, language corpora, and in the same time many research algorithms such as word segmentation, keyword extraction, information extraction have also been developed to provide a service via the standard API.

Language Resource

In current statistical approach for NLP research, collections of language resources are crucial in generating the language model. Many types of language resources can be prepared depending on the purpose of study. They can be part-of-speech (POS) tagged corpus, bracketed corpus (syntactic and/or semantic annotated corpus, or parse tree corpus), parallel translated corpus, speech corpus and several types of lexicon. To generate such a kind of language resource there are many issues to overcome such as annotation consistency, word/phrase level alignment, multi level annotation, standardization since we have to handle a large number of language data.

Innovations of Information Communication Technology provides us great convenience, however it often causes new types of legal confusions. Traditional legislations don’t know computers and internet. To surface new incidents, it is required to update legal systems to affect well in information era. However, Legal system is delicate, complicated works of history. It is absolutely required to keep the integrity of law. My research interest is balance of innovation and integrity in the world of law. Examples of research being conducted include intellectual property, e-commerce, privacy protection, and prevention of cybercrimes.

","Performance Analysis of Ergonomics-based Manual Assembly Line with Parallel Workstations and Floaters

It has been long known that manual assembly tasks are repetitive and require the use of specific muscles in the upper extremities, creating excessive postural and physical loads on the excessively used body members. As a result, manual assembly line workers are at high risk of cumulative trauma disorders in the upper extremities. When ergonomics concerns are introduced to the manual assembly line balancing problem to assign assembly tasks to workers to achieve the maximum postural-physical loads smoothness, the resulting task-workstation assignment solution must be determined using an ergonomics-based approach. Unfortunately, the line throughput is likely to decrease since the balance delay of the line might be compromised. This research project is intended to investigate the effect of adding parallel workstations to some potential bottleneck workstations and providing floaters (or extra helpers) to those parallel workstations so as to increase the assembly line productivity. Additionally, several strategies for opening parallel workstations and rotating floaters among them will be investigated with respect to various desired throughput rates. The Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) technique will be used to assess the postural and physical loads imposing on the musculoskeletal system of the body when performing each manual assembly task. A heuristic procedure will be employed to assign assembly tasks to workstations using a mixed productivity and ergonomics consideration. Based on predefined dispatching strategies to assign floaters and rotate them among parallel workstations, simulation models will be developed. The performance of the given manual assembly line under different throughput rate requirements and operational conditions will be analyzed. The variables of interest include: throughput rate, number of full-time workstations, number of parallel workstations, number of floaters, dispatching strategy, and switchover strategy. The performance indices are: achieved throughput rate, balance delay, utilization rates of full-time and parallel workstations, switchover rates, and average queue lengths at full-time workstations.

Ergonomics-based Workforce Scheduling for the Vehicle Routing Problem

The vehicle routing problem is intended to determine the optimal number of vehicles to delivery goods between finite sets of origins and destinations, and their delivery routes. There are numerous variants of the vehicle scheduling problem that have been studied by operations research and industrial engineering researchers. However, very few (if any) have paid attention to the vehicle drivers. In real-world situations, vehicle drivers might not only drive delivery vehicles but also perform loading and unloading of goods at both the origins and destinations. With limited time windows, loading/unloading operations may require more than one person to perform. Moreover, long-distance driving is stressful and increases the risk of highway accidents. Alternate drivers may be required for certain delivery routes. This research project is intended to take the loading/unloading workload and long-distance driving into consideration when finding the optimal workforce schedule for the vehicle routing problem. Based on the given delivery loads (in terms of required energy costs) and the driving distances for individual delivery trucks, a heuristic approach will be developed to determine the minimum numbers of vehicles and operators (drivers and movers) and their delivery routes so as to minimize the total traveling distance without exceeding the recommended daily energy expenditure and driving distance.

Workforce Scheduler: An Ergonomic Manpower Management Tool

This research project is intended to develop a computerized tool called Workforce Scheduler for ergonomically managing manpower for the hazardous work system. A group of industrial workers will receive daily work assignments to operate/attend a set of machines/workstations in the workplace where ergonomics, safety, and health hazards are present. Job rotation will be implemented to alleviate the workers’ hazard exposures. The types of hazard considered in Workforce Scheduler include industrial noise, heat, over-exhaustion, over-exertion, and toxic gases. Workers may be considered as identical or non-identical receivers, depending on the type of hazard and body tolerance. Workforce Scheduler allows the user to choose between the single-hazard exposure option and the two-hazard exposure option. The permissible daily exposure level must be specified prior to the workforce scheduling. Workforce Scheduler will determine the daily work assignment for each worker such that his/her hazard exposure does not exceed the permissible level. Additionally, weekly work schedule for the worker can be set so that his/her daily hazard exposures for different workdays will not be the same.

With the introduction of the Internet, firms can introduce a web-based channel to sell products directly to the consumers and this channel competes directly with the traditional channel: retailer stores. The research aims to study the outcomes of the competition under demand uncertainty and how to maximize the total supply chain profit. The coordination mechanism between the channels is analyzed and proposed.

","Information Sharing Between Partners in a Supply Chain

Knowledge and information are widely recognized as a potential competitive advantage in supply chain management. Several studies have shown that cooperation and information sharing can increase benefits, reduce cost, or both. On the other hand, firms may experience a negative reverse-impact, when a receiving partner uses the transferred information to manage its supply chain, resulting in an outcome that hurts the sharing partner. In general, every firm attempts to maintain the competitiveness of a monopoly, while at the same time tries to gain the additional benefit of interorganization cooperation. To balance these risks and benefits, firms need quantitative tools to assist in making decisions regarding information sharing. Such tools would be most valuable if they determine how much and what information should be shared as well as when, with whom, and under what conditions. This research explores these issues through a methodology based on game theory.

Agri-Food Supply Chain Management

Agri-food supply chains widely range from food safety and quality assurance to logistics and business modeling. In modern food retail and food service industries, safe and nutritional food in excellent quality with just-in-time delivery, is expected by customers, especially in developed countries. Developing countries such as Thailand, as food suppliers, have sought opportunities in cross border trade, to developed countries. To expand markets, there are needs in product and process improvement, in both food quality assurance and value creation. However, other important considerations including agriculture sustainability, energy efficiency, and welfare of workforce, should be considered together with cost reduction and profit maximization. This research studies assessment and effectiveness of current configurations and investigates balance and sustainable improvement of food supply chains in developing countries. This research is conducted and validated based on supply chain analysis, optimization, and simulation models.

Strategic Management

Strategic management focuses on the management process involving strategic formulation, strategic implementation, and control. The goal is to continuously assess the organization’s external factors (e.g., economy, politics, competitors) and internal factors (e.g., human resources, financial resources, core competencies) in order to create and sustain competitive advantages. This field of study explains how and why some firms outperform others.

MNE Strategies

Multinational Enterprises (MNEs) deal with a relatively higher level of uncertainty and changes than pure domestic firms due to the additional global macroenvironmental factors that can have significant impacts on these firms’ strategies and performance. As such, MNEs’ strategic fomulation, implementation, and control processes are much more complex. Global trends and events must also be taken into consideration by the MNE top-level management when developing strategies to compete globally.

Entrepreneurial Intentions

Entrepreneurial intentions refer to the entrepreneurs’ determination to start new business ventures. The study of entrepreneurial intentions enables entrepreneurship researchers to better understand and predict entrepreneurial activities. As a result, policy makers can improve policies to promote and support entrepreneurship for economic growth and development. The entrepreneurs can also benefit from a better understanding of their own motivations.

Globalization and information technologies (IT) are drastically changing the face of business and organization. We are all experiencing one of the most noticeable changes to our daily lives - the move to an Internet-based society. At present, there is a growing interest in the use of Electronic business as means to perform business transactions. IT are being adopted and incorporated into nearly all organizations, which have invested heavily in IT infrastructure for the overall success of their businesses. Through using Electronic business, companies are able to connect with their trading partners, which improve their competitiveness globally. Not only Electronic business could create the Web-based businesses, it is the building of new industrial order. Such a revolution brings a myriad of opportunities as well as risks. Electronic business is an exciting area for research because of its relative novelty and exploding growth.

Business Process Outsourcing
?
Despite the widespread trends in business process outsourcing, there has been too little focus on what happens to the shareholder wealth and firm value when an organization outsources. Typically, organizations simply lack the means and experiential research to assign value to business processes they are transferring and receiving. That is, they have no real understanding of how new value can be created in business process outsourcing situations, let alone exploited. This is a continuation of my dissertation research which focused on the shareholder wealth effect of business process outsourcing to the firm.",ASSISTANT PROFESSOR,"2006- Present: SIIT

","Construction Safety Culture

Throughout the world, the construction industry has had a poor safety record, and is disproportionately more dangerous when compared to other industries. The major cause of construction accidents is attributed to unsafe behaviors and work practices, which are viewed as the direct result of having a poor safety culture. The development of a mature safety culture has been recognized as a vital element in the achievement of high standards of safety, alongside an effective safety management system. A better understanding of how to improve safety culture greatly assists an organization to allocate appropriate safety resources, and thus improve its overall occupational health and safety performance.

System Dynamics Modeling

The system dynamics (SD) modeling was first introduced by Forrester (1961) as a method for modeling and analyzing the behavior of complex social systems, particularly in an industrial context. It has been used to examine various social, economic, and environmental systems, where a holistic view is important, and feedback loops are critical to the understanding of interrelationships. A SD simulation approach relies on an understanding of complex interrelationships existing among different elements within a system. This understanding is achieved by developing a model that can simulate and quantify the behavior of the system over time. Such simulations are considered essential in understanding the dynamics of the system.

Risk Management
","Decision Support Systems

Decision Support Systems (DSS) are a specific class of computerized information system that supports business and organizational decision-making activities. A properly designed DSS is an interactive software-based system intended to help decision makers compile useful information from raw data, documents, personal knowledge, and/or business models to identify and solve problems and make decisions.

Risk Management

Risk is the net negative impact of the exercise of vulnerability, considering both the probability and the impact of occurrence. Risk management is the process of identifying risk, assessing risk, and taking steps to reduce risk to an acceptable level.
It is critical for any organization to establish foundation for the development of an effective risk management program, containing both the definitions and the practical guidance necessary for assessing and mitigating risks identified within the organization. The ultimate goal is to help organizations to better manage mission-related risks.

","Energy Conservation and Energy Efficiency

Energy management is the effective use of energy to maximise profits (minimise costs). A comprehensive energy management program is not purely technical. It takes into account planning and communication as well as marketing. Energy management includes energy productivity and energy awareness. Energy conservation and energy efficency in residential and commerical buildings, transportation and industries are necessary to the country, as an energy importing country. To achieve energy saving targets, information on end-use devices in residential and commercial buildings, industries, and transport demand is necessary.

Integrated Resource Planning and CO2 Mitigation

Traditionally, the method used in the power expansion process is to identify the sequence of generation additions, which results in supplying the forecast load at the minimum total costs. This has concentrated almost exclusively on conventional supply-side fossil-based options. However, the saving of electricity through a demand side management (DSM) program is equivalent to building a new power generating unit. This concept is known as integrated resource planning (IRP). Therefore, the DSM options in the energy sector are evaluated in the IRP process. In addition to energy efficiency improvement, CO2emissions and other environmental emissions are mitigated in the IRP process when both DSM options and renewable energy technologies & low-carbon technologies are included.

Energy-Environment Modeling and CO2 Mitigation

The energy-environment modeling accounts for how energy is consumed, converted and produced in a given energy system under a range of alternative assumptions on population and GDP, economic development, technology, price, market penetration rates for new technologies such as efficient end-use devices and renewable energy technologies, fuel availability and trade, and CO2 emissions.

Methodologies include both top-down projections of energy demand based on macroeconomic indicators (price, GDP), and detailed bottom-up forecasts based on end-use analysis. In addition, both final and useful energy demand analyses, transport demand modeling for transportation, and technology and environmental databases, such as GHG emisisons database, are included.

The alternative energy demand and supply strategies under different user defined and physical constraints can be formulated and evaluated under simulation methods in scenario-based modeling or optimisation methods using Linear Programming (LP) and Non-Linear Programming (NLP).

Biomass is one of the major primary energy sources in Thailand. Residues and wastes collected on a large scale from agricultural and forest-related activities such as rice, sugar, wood, and palm oil industries can be used (alternatively to fossil fuels) as energy sources for heat and power production in this country. Thus, the development of highly efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly technologies for biomass utilization with the aim of energy production, is a problem of paramount importance for the Thai energy sector. Due to some advantages, fluidized-bed combustion technology seems to be the most suitable for energy conversion of biomass. Conical fluidized-bed combustors of various modifications have been proposed and are being studied. The research objectives include: (1) investigation of fluidization characteristics of the bed material in conical prototypes; (2) study of the effects of fuel and bed material types as well as operating conditions (including air staging) on the combustion efficiency and emission characteristics of the combustor; (3) study of the physical and chemical factors affecting formation and reduction of major pollutants in the combustor; (4) optimization of the combustor design and its operating conditions; (5) assessment of environmental impacts for various biomass fuels; (6) study on co-firing of different biomass fuels and/or co-firing of biomass with coal in a conical fluidized bed.

","Simulation Modelling and Analysis

Simulation is one of the most powerful analysis tools responsible for the design and operation of complex systems. Simulation involves the modelling of a process or system in such a way that the model mimics the response of the actual system to events that take place over time. The model can be used to predict future behaviour and the effects produced by changes in the systems or in its method of operation.

Cellular Manufacturing Systems (CMS)

CMS is another form of manufacturing system which applies the concept of group technology to provide some of the operational advantages of a flow shop while maintaining some of the strategic advantages of the job shop. Many research areas are involved in the concept including different types of cell formation and production planning for controlling the operation within and among the cells (inter-cell workload transfer).


Production Planning and Control (PPC)

Production planning uses the information from product and sales planning to plan the aggregate rates of production and the inventory levels. The objective of production planning is to provide sufficient finished goods in a period to meet the sales plan objectives while staying within financial and production capacity constraints. It is one of the richest areas that still requires further research.

Economic and Strategic Justification Methods

The main objective of justification processes is to justify an investment to see whether or not it is worth investing. However, in justifying new manufacturing technologies, traditional justification methods, with their overemphasis on short-term savings, cause these projects to be rejected while others fail to come up to expectation. Many forms of the integration of economic analysis which provides results in monetary terms with strategic analysis showing results from evaluator rating of his or her subjective feeling are an interesting area for further research.

Guideline or Methodology for Developing the Appropriate P&IC System for Thai Industries
","Small- to medium-sized industries (SMIs) in Thailand face considerable production and inventory control (P&IC) problems. These problems greatly deteriorate the manufacturing competitiveness of SMIs. In order to alleviate the problems, their characteristics and causes should be analyzed. Some causes of the problems are manageable while others are non-manageable. The non-manageable problems must be considered as constraints for developing the P&IC systems. The P&IC systems suitable for the SMIs in Thailand should be developed based on these constraints. Particular research topics in this research area are listed as follows:

Analyses of Production and Inventory Control Problems in Thai Industries

There are various possible problems related to the production and inventory control (P&IC) systems in Thai industries. The nature, characteristics, and causes of such problems should be known in order to design an appropriate P&IC system or to improve the performance of the system. This research aims to identify the characteristics and also real causes of the encountered P&IC problems in Thai industries using an interview survey and case studies.

Guideline or Methodology for Developing the Appropriate P&IC System for Thai Industries

It is reasonable to assume that the situation of industries in developed and developing countries are different. Therefore, the P&IC systems widely used in developed countries, for example, Just-in-Time, MRP, and TOC (Theory of Constraints) may not be suitable for Thai industries. An entirely new system or a modification of certain existing systems may be required by Thai industries. This research aims to recommend P&IC techniques or systems suitable for Thai industries by focusing on aggregate planning, master production scheduling, detailed production and purchasing scheduling, and shop floor control.

","Heat Powered Refrigeration Cycles
1. Absorption refrigeration system
2. Jet Refrigeration system
","Heat Powered Refrigeration Cycles

Refrigeration system is a thermodynamics cycle that removes heat from an enclosed space, or from a substance, and rejects out to the surrounding at a higher temperature. In most of refrigeration systems, the liquid refrigerant is evaporated at a low pressure and is condensed back to liquid at a higher temperature. The refrigerant can absorb a heat at a low temperature during the evaporation process and condense back to liquid by reject heat out to the surrounding during the condensation process. Many types of refrigeration systems have been invented for long time. The most common system used is known as “a vapor-compression refrigeration system”. In this system, the elevation of the refrigerant pressure is achieved by mean of a mechanical compressor. This system is operated using electrical energy input to the mechanical compressor. Therefore it is known as a worked- operated refrigeration system.
Since energy consumption and environmental problems have become serious issue for the present world, there are many attempts to reduce the use of electricity in refrigeration process. Heat powered refrigeration systems seem to be one of the most appropriate systems for the current energy and environment situations. Unlike the work-operated refrigeration systems, the many industrial waste heat can be recovered and converted to produce the useful refrigeration. As a result, the electricity purchased from utility companies for producing refrigeration from a conventional vapor compression refrigerator can be reduced. Therefore, the use of a heat powered refrigeration system helps reduce problems related to the global environment, such as emissions from burning fossil fuels in utility power plants. There are two well- known types of heat operated refrigeration systems: a jet refrigeration system and an absorption refrigeration system.
Description of Past and Current Research Activities

1. Absorption refrigeration system
Absorption refrigeration cycle is a combination of a separation process and an absorption process of a binary solution consisting of refrigerant and absorbent. In this system, the liquid refrigerant is evaporated a low pressure as it is absorbed in to solution. The solution is then pumped to a high pressure and is heated to a high temperature. The refrigerant is driven of from the solution and condensed by rejecting heat out to the surrounding, similar to a vapour compression system.
For typical absorption refrigeration systems, a circulation pump is required to circulate the solution. Our research in the field of Absorption refrigeration cycle was an investigation of a diffusion absorption refrigerator (DAR) which is a truly heat powered refrigeration system. It can be operated without any use of electrical or mechanical energy. Circulation of its working fluid is achieved using a bubble-pump.
2. Jet Refrigeration system
An ejector refrigeration cycle is similar to a typical vapor-compression cycle except that an ejector is use to replace the role of compressor with the addition of a vapour generator or boiler and a pump to provide thermal energy.
Even though, the jet refrigeration system provide relatively low Coefficient of Performance (COP), compared to other types of refrigeration cycles, It utilizes a low temperature thermal energy (100-200oC) from inexpensive or even free sources such as industrial wasted heat or a solar collector.
Performance of a jet refrigeration system depends greatly on an equipped ejector. In order to design and develop a high performance ejector, a clear understanding of the flow and mixing inside the ejector is first needed.
In the past, ejectors were designed and analyzed based on a classical theory which was based on one dimensional gas dynamic theory. However, this theory can be used to predict the performance when the ejector is operated at its design condition only. Moreover, effects of the ejector’s geometries were not included. Recently, with the rapid development of numerical solution method, some researchers attempted to apply Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in modeling the flow within ejectors.

Our past and current research in the field of jet refrigeration system were conducted and investigated experimentally and numerically (a CFD software). A CFD package was used to analyze the ejectors which were equipped in the experimental jet refrigeration cycles. The effects of operating conditions and geometries on its performance were investigated and validated with the actual values. Even though no correction factors were added as was done in one-dimensional theories, it was found that the CFD method provides reliable results compared to the actual values from the experiment. Unlike one-dimensional theories, a constant mass flow which is a typical characteristic of an ejector was shown. The theory described the flow and mixing process within the ejector was proposed.
As stated previously, the jet refrigeration system provides low COP compares to other types of refrigeration system. Thus, to make the system more competitive, apart from using the mechanical driven pump, alternate ways to return a liquid refrigerant to the boiler have been proposed. Our researches on the field are the development of the new circulation system to a jet refrigerator as shown in the following figure. This system fed the liquid condensate back to the generator by means of gravitational force and the generator pressure. The system is name as “the workless-generator feeding system (WGF)”. The requirement of the mechanical pump was eliminated. Thus the system becomes the purely heat-operated cycle. The system was also practical where the system height was limited.",PROFESSOR,"1995-Present: SIIT

","Energy conservation and management
solar energy
","With a background in mechanical engineering and energy technology, research activities and interests include both energy equipment design, development and applications, as well as energy system planning and management.
Energy conservation and management in industries and in large commercial buildings in Thailand is an area which still needs a lot of research. The main topics include energy analysis of potential savings, thermal energy storage (cool/ice storage) for air-conditioning system, cogeneration system for industries which require both heat and electricity simultaneously, industrial waste heat recovery and evaporative cooling.

The transportation sector accounts for about 40% of total energy demand in Thailand and, in addition, fuels used are mainly from imported petroleum. This not only affects the country economy but burning fossil fuels also produces air pollution as well as CO2 which is a main greenhouse gas emission. Research topics under investigation include the development of Bangkok driving modes for various types of vehicles, assessment of the use of catalytic converters in gasoline cars, and the effects of using vegetable oils in diesel engines.

Another field of research to be mentioned is concerned with solar energy; both thermal and electrical applications. Interesting topics under consideration are the design and development of low cost solar water heaters using local materials, solar-photovoltaic refrigerators for use in remote areas where electricity from the utility grid is not available, modeling of solar PV/thermal systems under various types of applications, development of standard methods for testing solar energy equipment, software packages for optimum sizing of solar energy systems.

Application of image processing in the rapid prototyping process
Structured Light System (SLS)
","Selective data acquisition for supporting direct integration between reverse engineering (RE) and rapid prototyping (RP)

Reverse engineering (RE) has been used closely with rapid prototyping (RP) for fabricating one object from another. Existing RE-RP integrations all begin with the data acquisition of the entire surface of an object. This large point cloud data contains redundancy that must be reduced to avoid unnecessary difficulty in a subsequent surface reconstruction step. Rather than performing data reduction after capturing the data of an entire object, data are acquired selectively and locally layer by layer, based on the part complexity, to minimize the number of scans. The results of each scan are contour data points, which can be directly used to generate commands for fabricating a prototype.

Application of image processing in the rapid prototyping process

Build time and accuracy are two contradicting issues that have been a major concern in rapid prototyping, and have led to the development of many slicing approaches, including those applying adaptive slicing, direct slicing, and adaptive direct slicing concepts. Applying image processing has become an interesting technique to determine appropriate thickness for each sliced layer in an adaptive direct slicing process and to recommend slicing positions on a 3D CAD model.

Structured Light System (SLS)

Structured light system is a non-contact measurement technique that has been developed based on an active triangulation method where a known pattern of light is projected onto an object.

Developing materials that can conduct electricity easily, but block the motion of phonons is necessary in the applications of thermoelectric devices, which can generate electricity from temperature differences. In converse, a key requirement as chips get faster is to obtain better ways to dissipate heat. Controlling heat transfer in these crystalline materials devices — such as silicon — is important. The heat is actually the motion or vibration of atoms known as phonons. Finding ways to manipulate the behavior of phonons is crucial for both energy applications and the cooling of integrated circuits.

",,"The solving of environmental problems and concerns over the sustainability of resource use have become one of the fundamental and most urgent tasks for us. My primary research interest is in the assessment of environmental impacts caused by industrial manufacturing processes and related activities. My approach to research revolves around the use of industrial engineering principles in conjunction with various environmental impact assessment methodologies. This allows us to achieve the operational performance objectives while at the same time take into consideration the environmental consequences and other sustainability issues. My previous research has included the investigation of the environmental impacts of nanomaterial-containing products at their end-of-life phases, the quantification of environmental impacts by the use of exergy concept, and the evaluation of direct/indirect water consumption along the supply chain of a manufacturing process.

","Mathematical Model for Hemodynamic and Intracranial Windkessel Mechanism
","Mathematical Model for Hemodynamic and Intracranial Windkessel MechanismThe understanding of intracranial system so that one can explain its related pathological condition such as hydrocephalus and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is still subtle. Especially, the cause of hydrocephalus which is known as the common birth defect is not well defined. Traditionally, hydrocephalus was described as imbalance between production and absorption process of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, many recent observations show that the bulk flow theory can no longer explain the cause of hydrocephalus. Hence, the new concept of hydrocephalus has been deviated from the bulk flow theory and comes to focus on the pulsatile dynamic of intracranial system and abnormalities of intracranial Windkessel mechanism. Thus, the simulation via mathematical model based on Windkessel mechanism, which is one of the most useful tool to clarify the pulsatile dynamic within intracranial cavity is developed. The mathematical model is constructed based on the mechanical and fluid mechanics principles to predict the hemodynamics throughout major arterial system and intracranial space.
